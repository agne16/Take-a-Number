# Take-a-Number
Senior Capstone Project

Take a Number is a suite of applications intended to optimize the rate at which instructors and lab aides provide help to students in computer lab based courses at the University of Portland

There are three components that contribute to the project as a whole:
- The **app** directory contains code for the Android application
- The **server** directory contains code for the Java based server application
- The **webpage** directory contains HTML files for a web interface
